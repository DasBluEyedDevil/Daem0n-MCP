    Async read-write lock implementation.

    Multiple readers can hold the lock simultaneously.

    This implementation uses asyncio.Condition for coordination:
    - Readers wait while a writer is active

    - When a writer releases, all waiting readers and one waiting writer are notified

        async with lock.read():
            data = await read_shared_resource()
