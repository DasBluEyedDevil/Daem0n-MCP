"""
ProjectContext lifecycle management for Daem0nMCP.

This module manages the creation, caching, eviction, and cleanup of
per-project context objects. Each ProjectContext holds the DatabaseManager,
MemoryManager, and RulesEngine for a single project.

Import hierarchy position:
    mcp_instance  (shared FastMCP -- no business imports)
        <- context_manager  (THIS MODULE -- ProjectContext lifecycle)
            <- tools/*  (tool definitions)
                <- server.py  (composition root)

This module does NOT import from mcp_instance, server, or any tools module.
It sits between the MCP instance and the tool implementations in the DAG.
