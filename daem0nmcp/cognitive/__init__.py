"""Cognitive tools -- the daemon's instruments of deeper reasoning.

This package provides the shared result types and orchestration logic
for the daemon's cognitive capabilities:

- **Temporal Scrying** (simulate): Reconstruct historical knowledge states
  and compare with current understanding to reveal what has changed.
- **Rule Entropy Analysis** (evolve): Detect staleness in the daemon's
  rule engine by cross-referencing code drift and outcome correlation.
- **Adversarial Council** (debate): Run structured advocate/challenger
  debates grounded entirely in memory evidence, with convergence detection.

All result dataclasses are defined here as the shared foundation used
by the individual cognitive modules (simulate.py, evolve.py, debate.py).
