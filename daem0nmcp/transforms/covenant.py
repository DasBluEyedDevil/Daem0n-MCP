"""
CovenantTransform - FastMCP 3.0 Transform for Sacred Covenant Enforcement.

This transform implements middleware-style interception of MCP tool calls
to enforce the Sacred Covenant protocol:

    COMMUNE (get_briefing) -> SEEK COUNSEL (context_check) -> INSCRIBE (remember) -> SEAL (record_outcome)

The transform can be used in two ways:
1. Standalone: Call check_tool_access() directly to validate tool calls
2. FastMCP Middleware: Use on_call_tool() hook when integrated with FastMCP 3.0

The Sacred Covenant flow ensures:
- AI agents commune with the Daem0n before any work (get briefing context)
- AI agents seek counsel before mutations (check for conflicts/duplicates)
- Decisions are inscribed with proper context
- Outcomes are sealed to track what worked/failed
