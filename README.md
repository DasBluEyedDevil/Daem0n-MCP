**AI Memory & Decision System** - Give AI agents persistent memory and consistent decision-making with *actual* semantic understanding.

## v7 Protocol Cutover

The public v7 MCP surface is strict and workspace-scoped. Begin with
`session_brief`, use `memory_recall` for bounded context, obtain an exact
`memory_preflight` capability before protected work, write decisions through
replay-safe `memory_store`, and finish with `memory_record_outcome`. Use
`system_health` for diagnostics.

Each scoped call uses an opaque `workspace_id`. The supported transports are
stdio and Streamable HTTP at `/mcp`. Read-only warnings, failures, rules, and
active context use the `memory://workspaces/{workspace_id}/...` resources. See
[`docs/v6-to-v7-tools.json`](docs/v6-to-v7-tools.json) for the generated
migration mapping.

## Historical v6 Migration Context: v6.6.6

### ModernBERT Deep Sight (BREAKING)
The daemon's vision has been fundamentally sharpened. The old `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` embedding model is replaced by **ModernBERT** with asymmetric query/document encoding and optional ONNX acceleration.

| Aspect | Old (v5.x) | New (v6.6.6) |
|--------|------------|--------------|
| **Model** | `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` | `nomic-ai/modernbert-embed-base` |
| **Dimensions** | 384 | 256 (Matryoshka truncation) |
| **Encoding** | Single `encode()` | Dual: `encode_query()` / `encode_document()` |
| **Backend** | PyTorch only | ONNX quantized (with torch fallback) |
| **Prefixes** | None | `search_query: ` / `search_document: ` |

**This is a BREAKING CHANGE for format 6** — existing format-6 embeddings must be re-encoded with the deprecated legacy command:
```bash
python -m daem0nmcp.migrations.migrate_embedding_model --project-path /path/to/.daem0nmcp
```

Architecture format 7 does not write canonical `memories.vector_embedding` data.
Rebuild its dense retrieval projection instead:

```bash
python -m daem0nmcp.cli rebuild-projection --projection dense --workspace-id <workspace-id>
```

### Background Dreaming
When the user goes idle, the daemon autonomously re-evaluates past failed decisions using current evidence:
- `IdleDreamScheduler` monitors tool call activity
- After configurable idle timeout (default 60s), `FailedDecisionReview` strategy runs
- Classifies decisions as **revised**, **confirmed_failure**, or **needs_more_data**
- Insights persisted as `learning` memories with `dream` tag and full provenance
- Yields immediately when user returns (cooperative scheduling)

### Cognitive Tools (3 new standalone MCP tools)
Meta-reasoning tools for daemon introspection:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `simulate_decision` | **Temporal Scrying** — replay a past decision with current knowledge, revealing what changed |
| `evolve_rule` | **Rule Entropy Analysis** — examine rules for staleness, code drift, and outcome correlation |
| `debate_internal` | **Adversarial Council** — structured evidence-grounded debate with convergence detection |

### Auto-Zoom Retrieval Routing
Query-aware search dispatch that routes to the optimal retrieval strategy:
- **SIMPLE** queries → Vector-only search (fast path)
- **MEDIUM** queries → Hybrid BM25+vector with RRF fusion
- **COMPLEX** queries → GraphRAG multi-hop traversal + community summaries
- Shadow mode (default) logs classifications without changing behavior
- All strategies fall back to hybrid on failure

### Claude Code Native Hooks
New `daem0nmcp/claude_hooks/` module with 5 lifecycle hooks and automated installation:
```bash
python -m daem0nmcp.cli install-claude-hooks      # Install to ~/.claude/settings.json
python -m daem0nmcp.cli uninstall-claude-hooks     # Remove
```

| Hook | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `session_start` | Suggest scoped `session_brief` at session dawn |
| `pre_edit` | Fail closed with exact `memory_preflight` guidance |
| `pre_bash` | Rule enforcement on bash commands |
| `post_edit` | Suggest replay-safe memory calls for significant changes |
| `stop` | Suggest memory and outcome calls without writing directly |

### Stats
- **8 workflow tools** + **3 cognitive tools** (11 MCP tools total)
- **59 workflow actions** across 8 workflows
- **500+ tests** passing

---

## Historical v6 Migration Context: v5.1.0

### Workflow Consolidation
v5.1 consolidates **67 individual MCP tools into 8 workflow-oriented tools**, dramatically reducing context overhead for AI agents while preserving all capabilities.

#### 8 Workflow Tools

| Workflow | Purpose | Actions |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **`commune`** | Session start & status | `briefing`, `active_context`, `triggers`, `health`, `covenant`, `updates` |
| **`consult`** | Pre-action intelligence | `preflight`, `recall`, `recall_file`, `recall_entity`, `recall_hierarchical`, `search`, `check_rules`, `compress` |
| **`inscribe`** | Memory writing & linking | `remember`, `remember_batch`, `link`, `unlink`, `pin`, `activate`, `deactivate`, `clear_active`, `ingest` |
| **`reflect`** | Outcomes & verification | `outcome`, `verify`, `execute` |
| **`understand`** | Code comprehension | `index`, `find`, `impact`, `todos`, `refactor` |
| **`govern`** | Rules & triggers | `add_rule`, `update_rule`, `list_rules`, `add_trigger`, `list_triggers`, `remove_trigger` |
| **`explore`** | Graph & discovery | `related`, `chain`, `graph`, `stats`, `communities`, `community_detail`, `rebuild_communities`, `entities`, `backfill_entities`, `evolution`, `versions`, `at_time` |
| **`maintain`** | Housekeeping & federation | `prune`, `archive`, `cleanup`, `compact`, `rebuild_index`, `export`, `import_data`, `link_project`, `unlink_project`, `list_projects`, `consolidate` |

#### How It Worked

Format 6 grouped individual operations behind an `action` discriminator. Those
calls are not executable v7 guidance. Use the generated
[`docs/v6-to-v7-tools.json`](docs/v6-to-v7-tools.json) mapping for the exact
replacement of every old operation.

#### Why Consolidate?
- **88% fewer tool definitions** in context (8 vs 67)
- **Lower token overhead** — AI agents load fewer tool schemas
- **Logical grouping** — related operations live in one tool
- **Backward compatible** — legacy individual functions remain importable for internal dispatch, but only the consolidated workflow and cognitive tools are exposed to MCP clients

## Historical v6 Migration Context: v5.0.0

### Visions of the Void (MCP Apps)
This v6 release added interactive HTML interfaces via MCP Apps (SEP-1865).
Those action-dispatch examples are intentionally omitted because they are not
valid v7 calls; use the generated migration mapping for current tool names.

Features: D3.js v7 bundled (105KB, no CDN), restrictive CSP, canvas-based graph (10,000+ nodes at 60fps), graceful text fallback for non-visual hosts.

---

## What's New in v4.0.0

### Cognitive Architecture
Five major capabilities:

- **GraphRAG & Leiden Communities**: Knowledge graph construction with hierarchical community detection, multi-hop queries, global search via community summaries
- **Bi-Temporal Knowledge**: Dual timestamps (`valid_time` vs `transaction_time`), `happened_at` backfilling, `as_of_time` point-in-time queries, contradiction detection
- **Metacognitive Reflexion**: Actor-Evaluator-Reflector loop, `verify` action validates claims against stored knowledge, reflection persistence
- **Context Engineering**: LLMLingua-2 for 3x-6x compression, code entity preservation, adaptive rates, `compress` action for on-demand optimization
- **Dynamic Agency**: `execute` action for sandboxed Python execution via E2B Firecracker microVMs

## Why Daem0nMCP?

AI agents start each session fresh. They don't remember:
- What decisions were made and why
- Patterns that should be followed
- Warnings from past mistakes

**Markdown files don't solve this** - the AI has to know to read them and might ignore them.

**Daem0nMCP provides ACTIVE memory** - it surfaces relevant context when the AI asks about a topic, enforces rules before actions, and learns from outcomes.

### What Makes This Different

- **Semantic matching**: "creating REST endpoint" matches rules about "adding API route"
- **Time decay**: A decision from yesterday matters more than one from 6 months ago
- **Conflict warnings**: "You tried this approach before and it failed"
- **Learning loops**: Record outcomes, and failures get boosted in future recalls
- **Surprise scoring**: Novel information surfaces above routine knowledge
- **Graph reasoning**: Multi-hop traversal across linked memories and communities
- **Background dreaming**: Idle-time re-evaluation of past failed decisions

## Quick Start

### Claude Code (The Easy Way)

1. Copy `Summon_Daem0n.md` to your project
2. Start a Claude Code session in that project
3. Claude will read the file and perform the summoning ritual automatically

### OpenCode

1. Install Daem0n-MCP: `pip install -e ~/Daem0n-MCP`
2. Run the installer: `python -m daem0nmcp.cli install-opencode`
3. Launch OpenCode in your project directory
4. Run `/commune <workspace_id>`; this host shortcut calls `session_brief`

For the full ritual walkthrough, see `Summon_Daem0n_OpenCode.md`.

### Manual Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/9thlevelsoftware/Daem0n-MCP.git ~/Daem0n-MCP

# Install
pip install -e ~/Daem0n-MCP

# Run the MCP server (Linux/macOS — stdio transport)
python -m daem0nmcp.server

# Run the MCP server (Windows — HTTP transport required)
python ~/Daem0n-MCP/start_server.py --port 9876
```

## Installation by Platform

### Linux / macOS (stdio transport)

```bash
# Find your Python path
python3 -c "import sys; print(sys.executable)"

# Register with Claude Code (replace <PYTHON_PATH>)
claude mcp add daem0nmcp --scope user -- <PYTHON_PATH> -m daem0nmcp.server

# Restart Claude Code
```

### Windows (HTTP transport required)

Windows has a known bug where Python MCP servers using stdio transport hang indefinitely. Use HTTP transport instead:

1. **Start the server** (keep this terminal open):
```bash
python ~/Daem0n-MCP/start_server.py --port 9876
```
Or use `start_daem0nmcp_server.bat`

2. **Add to `~/.claude.json`**:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "daem0nmcp": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://localhost:9876/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

3. **Start Claude Code** (after server is running)

### Transport Modes

| Method | Transport | Default Port | Use Case |
|--------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `python -m daem0nmcp.server` | `stdio` | n/a | Local process channel |
| `python start_server.py` | Streamable HTTP at `/mcp` | 9876 | Windows HTTP, remote access |

For OpenCode setup, see the [OpenCode Integration](#opencode-integration) section below, or run `python -m daem0nmcp.cli install-opencode` for automated setup.

## v7 MCP API

The v7 public API uses strict, workspace-scoped tools rather than action
dispatch. The core protocol surface is:

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `session_brief` | Establish the server-issued session scope and return a bounded briefing |
| `memory_preflight` | Recall guidance and issue a capability for one exact protected request |
| `memory_recall` | Retrieve bounded, evidence-bearing records |
| `memory_store` | Append one replay-safe memory record |
| `memory_record_outcome` | Append a verified success or failure outcome |
| `system_health` | Return bounded service and projection diagnostics |

The read-only JSON resources are:

- `memory://workspaces/{workspace_id}/warnings`
- `memory://workspaces/{workspace_id}/failures`
- `memory://workspaces/{workspace_id}/rules`
- `memory://workspaces/{workspace_id}/active-context`

See [`docs/v6-to-v7-tools.json`](docs/v6-to-v7-tools.json) for the generated
mapping of every v6 operation to its v7 replacement.

### Tool Names by Client

Recognize only the exact canonical name or its host prefix:

| Canonical | Claude Code | OpenCode |
|---|---|---|
| `session_brief` | `mcp__daem0nmcp__session_brief` | `daem0nmcp_session_brief` |
| `memory_preflight` | `mcp__daem0nmcp__memory_preflight` | `daem0nmcp_memory_preflight` |
| `memory_recall` | `mcp__daem0nmcp__memory_recall` | `daem0nmcp_memory_recall` |
| `memory_store` | `mcp__daem0nmcp__memory_store` | `daem0nmcp_memory_store` |
| `memory_record_outcome` | `mcp__daem0nmcp__memory_record_outcome` | `daem0nmcp_memory_record_outcome` |
| `system_health` | `mcp__daem0nmcp__system_health` | `daem0nmcp_system_health` |

Host metadata is never an identity source. Authentication comes from the
transport, and every scoped request is resolved through `workspace_id`.

## Usage Examples

### Session Start

```text
session_brief(
    workspace_id="<workspace_id>",
    focus_areas=["authentication", "API"]
)
```

### Retrieve Memories

```text
memory_recall(
    workspace_id="<workspace_id>",
    query="authentication",
    limit=10,
    token_budget=2400
)
```

### Store a Memory

First request a capability bound to the exact target arguments:

```text
memory_preflight(
    workspace_id="<workspace_id>",
    target_tool="memory_store",
    target_arguments={
        "record_type": "decision",
        "content": "Use signed session cookies",
        "rationale": "Avoid server-side session state",
        "tags": ["auth", "architecture"],
        "relative_file_path": "src/auth/session.py",
        "idempotency_key": "decision-auth-session-0001"
    }
)
```

Then use the same arguments and returned token:

```text
memory_store(
    workspace_id="<workspace_id>",
    record_type="decision",
    content="Use signed session cookies",
    rationale="Avoid server-side session state",
    tags=["auth", "architecture"],
    relative_file_path="src/auth/session.py",
    idempotency_key="decision-auth-session-0001",
    preflight_token="<token-from-memory_preflight>"
)
```

### Track Outcomes

```text
memory_record_outcome(
    workspace_id="<workspace_id>",
    record_id="<mem_id>",
    outcome_text="The implementation passed integration tests",
    worked=true,
    idempotency_key="outcome-auth-session-0001"
)
```

## AI Agent Protocol

The recommended workflow for AI agents:

```text
session_brief
    -> memory_recall (when relevant)
    -> memory_preflight (exact protected tool + exact arguments)
    -> protected tool with preflight_token
    -> memory_store (for durable decisions, replay-safe)
    -> memory_record_outcome (after verification, replay-safe)
```

Use `system_health` for bounded diagnostics. The complete protocol lives in
`AGENTS.md` and `.claude/skills/daem0nmcp-protocol/SKILL.md`.

## Claude Code Integration

### Automated Hook Installation (Recommended)

```bash
python -m daem0nmcp.cli install-claude-hooks
```

This registers 5 hook modules in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

| Event | Hook | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `SessionStart` | `session_start` | Scoped `session_brief` instruction |
| `PreToolUse` (Edit/Write/NotebookEdit) | `pre_edit` | Fail-closed v7 preflight instruction |
| `PreToolUse` (Bash) | `pre_bash` | Rule enforcement on commands |
| `PostToolUse` (Edit/Write) | `post_edit` | Replay-safe memory suggestion |
| `Stop`/`SubagentStop` | `stop` | Outcome reminder without direct memory writes |

To remove: `python -m daem0nmcp.cli uninstall-claude-hooks`

### Manual Hooks (Legacy)

Add to `.claude/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "Edit|Write|NotebookEdit",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "python3 \"$HOME/Daem0nMCP/hooks/daem0n_pre_edit_hook.py\""
      }]
    }],
    "PostToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "Edit|Write",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "python3 \"$HOME/Daem0nMCP/hooks/daem0n_post_edit_hook.py\""
      }]
    }],
    "Stop": [{
      "matcher": "",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "python3 \"$HOME/Daem0nMCP/hooks/daem0n_stop_hook.py\""
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

### Protocol Skill

A Claude Code skill is included at `.claude/skills/daem0nmcp-protocol/SKILL.md` that enforces the memory protocol automatically.

## OpenCode Integration

OpenCode connects to Daem0n-MCP via the same MCP server. No server changes required -- the daemon serves all clients equally.

### Configuration

Create `opencode.json` at your project root:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "mcp": {
    "daem0nmcp": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["python", "-m", "daem0nmcp"],
      "enabled": true,
      "environment": {
        "PYTHONUNBUFFERED": "1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For Windows (where HTTP transport is required), use:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "mcp": {
    "daem0nmcp": {
      "type": "remote",
      "url": "http://localhost:9876/mcp",
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

### System Instructions

OpenCode reads `AGENTS.md` from the project root for system prompt injection. The Sacred Covenant protocol is included in `AGENTS.md` with OpenCode-compatible tool names.

If both `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` exist in a project, OpenCode uses only `AGENTS.md`.

### Tool Names

OpenCode uses a different tool name format than Claude Code:

| Client | Format | Example |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Claude Code | `mcp__servername__toolname` | `mcp__daem0nmcp__session_brief` |
| OpenCode | `servername_toolname` | `daem0nmcp_session_brief` |

Both formats resolve to the same MCP server tools. Use the exact form matching
your client. See [Tool Names by Client](#tool-names-by-client).

## How It Works

### Hybrid Search (BM25 + Vector + RRF)
- **BM25** for keyword matching with term saturation and length normalization
- **ModernBERT** vector embeddings (256-dim, asymmetric encoding) for deep semantic understanding
- **Reciprocal Rank Fusion** combines both with configurable weights
- "blocking database calls" matches memories about "synchronous queries"

### Auto-Zoom Retrieval Routing
Query-aware dispatch classifies complexity and routes to the optimal strategy:
- Simple queries → vector-only (fast path)
- Medium queries → hybrid BM25+vector
- Complex queries → GraphRAG multi-hop with community summaries

### Memory Decay
```
weight = e^(-lambda*t) where lambda = ln(2)/half_life_days
```
Default half-life is 30 days. Patterns and warnings are permanent (no decay).

### Conflict Detection
When storing a new memory, it's compared against recent memories:
- If similar content failed before → warning about the failure
- If it matches an existing warning → warning surfaced
- If highly similar content exists → potential duplicate flagged

### Failed Decision Boosting
Memories with `worked=False` get a 1.5x relevance boost in recalls.
Warnings get a 1.2x boost. Past mistakes surface prominently.

### Background Dreaming
During idle periods, the daemon re-evaluates failed decisions against current evidence. `FailedDecisionReview` strategy finds `worked=False` decisions, recalls current evidence, and persists actionable insights as `learning` memories. Yields cooperatively when the user returns.

## Data Storage

Each project gets isolated storage at:
```
<project_root>/.daem0nmcp/storage/daem0nmcp.db
```

## Configuration

All settings are configurable via environment variables with `DAEM0NMCP_` prefix.

### Core Settings

| Variable | Default | Description |

## CLI Commands

```bash
# Index code entities
python -m daem0nmcp.cli index [--path PATH] [--patterns **/*.py **/*.ts ...]

# Scan for TODO/FIXME/HACK comments
python -m daem0nmcp.cli scan-todos [--auto-remember] [--path PATH]

# Check a file against memories and rules
python -m daem0nmcp.cli check <filepath>

# Run database migrations (usually automatic; vector backfill is format 6 only)
python -m daem0nmcp.cli migrate [--backfill-vectors]

# Inspect a v7 retrieval projection
python -m daem0nmcp.cli projection-status --workspace-id <workspace_id>

# Rebuild a v7 retrieval projection from canonical events
python -m daem0nmcp.cli rebuild-projection --projection dense --workspace-id <workspace_id>
```

### Hook & Enforcement Commands

```bash
# Install Claude Code hooks (user-level, all projects)
python -m daem0nmcp.cli install-claude-hooks [--dry-run]

# Remove Claude Code hooks
python -m daem0nmcp.cli uninstall-claude-hooks [--dry-run]

# Install OpenCode configuration (project-level)
python -m daem0nmcp.cli install-opencode [--dry-run] [--force]
# Creates: opencode.json, .opencode/ directories, .opencode/plugins/daem0n.ts
# AGENTS.md and command files are not auto-created

# Install git pre-commit hooks
python -m daem0nmcp.cli install-hooks [--force]

# Remove git pre-commit hooks
python -m daem0nmcp.cli uninstall-hooks

```

Use MCP `memory_record_outcome` for v7 outcomes. It requires an opaque
`workspace_id`, a v7 `record_id`, and a stable idempotency key.

## Upgrading

### 1. Update the Code

```bash
# If installed from source (recommended)
cd ~/Daem0n-MCP && git pull && pip install -e .

```

### 2. Re-encode Embeddings (legacy format 6 only)

The embedding model changed from `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384-dim) to `nomic-ai/modernbert-embed-base` (256-dim).

> **Deprecated (format 6 only):** These legacy writers update the mutable
> `memories.vector_embedding` column or legacy Qdrant collections. They refuse
> an active format-7 database before making changes.

```bash
# Re-encode the format-6 SQLite column (and local Qdrant, when present)
python -m daem0nmcp.migrations.migrate_embedding_model --project-path /path/to/.daem0nmcp

# Copy existing format-6 SQLite vectors to legacy Qdrant
python -m daem0nmcp.migrations.migrate_vectors --project-path /path/to/project

# Backfill missing format-6 SQLite vectors
python -m daem0nmcp.cli --project-path /path/to/project migrate --backfill-vectors
```

For architecture format 7, rebuild the dense retrieval projection from canonical
events. Supply the registered workspace ID reported by the v7 migration/status
commands:

```bash
python -m daem0nmcp.cli rebuild-projection --projection dense --workspace-id <workspace-id>
```

### 3. Install Claude Code Hooks

```bash
python -m daem0nmcp.cli install-claude-hooks
```

### 4. Restart Claude Code

After updating, restart Claude Code to load the new MCP tools.

### 4b. Update OpenCode Configuration (if using OpenCode)

```bash
python -m daem0nmcp.cli install-opencode --force
```

This regenerates `opencode.json` and the plugin to match the latest version.

### 5. Migrations Run Automatically

Database schema migrations are applied automatically when any MCP tool runs. No manual migration step required.

### 6. Index Your Codebase

```bash
python -m daem0nmcp.cli index
```

Supports Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, Go, Rust, Java, C, C++, C#, Ruby, PHP via tree-sitter.

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Tools Not Available in Claude Session

**Symptom:** `claude mcp list` shows daem0nmcp connected, but Claude can't use `mcp__daem0nmcp__*` tools.

**Fixes:**

1. **Start server before Claude Code (Windows):**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Start Daem0n server first
   python ~/Daem0n-MCP/start_server.py --port 9876
   # Wait for "Uvicorn running on http://localhost:9876"

   # Terminal 2: Then start Claude Code
   claude
   ```

2. **Re-register the server:**
   ```bash
   claude mcp remove daem0nmcp -s user
   claude mcp add daem0nmcp http://localhost:9876/mcp -s user
   ```

### Hooks Not Firing

1. MCP server running: `curl http://localhost:9876/mcp` should respond
2. Hooks configured: check `~/.claude/settings.json` or `.claude/settings.json`
3. Project has `.daem0nmcp/` directory

### Covenant Errors

- `COMMUNION_REQUIRED` → Call `session_brief(workspace_id="<workspace_id>")` first
- `COUNSEL_REQUIRED` → Follow the returned remedy and call
  `memory_preflight(workspace_id="<workspace_id>", target_tool="<exact-tool>", target_arguments={<exact-arguments>})`

### OpenCode: Tools Not Found

**Symptom:** OpenCode reports "tool not found" when using `mcp__daem0nmcp__*` format.

**Fix:** OpenCode uses the exact single-underscore form
`daem0nmcp_session_brief`; Claude Code uses
`mcp__daem0nmcp__session_brief`. See [Tool Names by Client](#tool-names-by-client).

### OpenCode: MCP Connection Timeout

**Symptom:** First tool call times out, but subsequent calls work.

**Fix:** The embedding model loads on first call (several seconds). Add `"timeout": 30000` to your opencode.json MCP config.

### OpenCode: Covenant Not Enforced

**Symptom:** No preflight warnings, no post-edit suggestions in OpenCode.

**Fix:**
1. Verify plugin exists: `ls .opencode/plugins/daem0n.ts`
2. Verify AGENTS.md contains the Sacred Covenant section
3. Check OpenCode logs for plugin errors

## Development

```bash
# Install in development mode
pip install -e .[dev]

# Run tests (500+ tests)
pytest tests/ -v --asyncio-mode=auto

# Run server directly (stdio)
python -m daem0nmcp.server

# Run HTTP server (Windows)
python start_server.py --port 9876
